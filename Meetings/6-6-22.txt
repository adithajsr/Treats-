We divided the work of creating stubbed functions; two for each person.
Jack has authLoginV1 and authRegisterV1
Caitlyn has channelsCreateV1 and channelslistV1
Rachel has channelsListallV1 and channelDetailsV1
Joseph has channelJoinV1 and channelInviteV1
Aditha has channelMessagesV1 and the Gym ;)

We also discussed and decided on the data structures required for our "UNSW Treats"
by catgeorising the data into infomration related to a user and to a channel, utilising snake_case.

Joseph, Aditha, Rachel, Caitlyn and Jack were present,
it was held in the Ainsworth level 3 labs from 14:06 - 15:17,
and a 15 minute video-call meeting also took place with tutor Joseph.
