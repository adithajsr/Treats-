Joseph unable to join.

Meeting formally commenced at 11:10AM

Discussing whether we should make two objects for users and channel or combine 
them under one object - decided that we should combine two objects under one object.

Ensuring that we have consistent syntax across our separate branches that we 
completed last meeting. 

Discovered that ChannelDetailsV1 overwrote ChannelMessagesV1 - Aditha rewrote 
ChannelMessagesV1 and merged into master. 

Discussed the importance of pulling often to ensure that this issue won't be 
repeated. 

Attempted dryrun - 7/9 tests passed. Discussed why the 2 tests failed - is it because
we altered some of the argument names provided in the interface? Caitlyn is editing 
and making a merge request to determine whether this is the issue. 

This worked! We have passed 9/9 tests.

Rachel altered data.md to reflect the changes to the parameters made in the function
stubs. She also added comments and cleaned the data structures up. 

One more dryrun check - PASSED.

MEETING OFFICIALLY CLOSED AT 12:30PM
